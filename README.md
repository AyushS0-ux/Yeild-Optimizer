# Yield Optimizer

A DeFi protocol that automatically maximizes returns by routing funds between different lending protocols on Core Chain.

## Project Description

The Yield Optimizer is a smart contract system built on Core Chain that helps users maximize their returns on stablecoin deposits. It achieves this by automatically monitoring yield rates across multiple lending protocols and strategically allocating user funds to the highest-yielding option available.

This project addresses a common DeFi pain point: manually monitoring and moving funds between protocols to chase the best yields is time-consuming, costly (due to gas fees), and requires constant attention. The Yield Optimizer solves this by automating the entire process, allowing users to deposit their assets once and let the system handle the optimization.

Built on Core Chain, this solution takes advantage of the network's EVM compatibility, lower transaction costs, and growing DeFi ecosystem to provide an efficient yield optimization service.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a user-friendly gateway to optimized DeFi yields that removes technical barriers and complexity. We believe that efficient capital allocation shouldn't require constant monitoring or deep technical knowledge.

Through this project, we aim to:

1. Democratize access to sophisticated yield strategies
2. Reduce the time and expertise needed to maximize returns
3. Lower the cost barriers associated with yield optimization
4. Create a sustainable protocol that grows alongside the Core Chain ecosystem

In the long term, we envision this Yield Optimizer becoming a foundational building block for more complex financial products on Core Chain, enabling users to earn optimized yields while maintaining liquidity for other DeFi activities.

## Key Feature

### Core Features

1. **Automated Yield Routing**: Smart contracts automatically detect and route funds to the highest-yielding protocol in our supported ecosystem.

2. **Simple Deposit/Withdraw Interface**: Users only need to interact with a single contract to deposit and withdraw funds, regardless of where their funds are allocated behind the scenes.

3. **Transparent APY Tracking**: Real-time tracking of yields across supported protocols with clear reporting on current and historical rates.

### Technical Features

1. **Protocol Abstraction Layer**: The Yield Optimizer interfaces with multiple lending protocols through a standardized abstraction layer, making it easy to add support for new protocols.

2. **Gas-Efficient Rebalancing**: The contract uses advanced logic to determine when rebalancing is profitable after accounting for transaction costs.

3. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: The optimizer considers not just raw yields but also protocol risk factors when making allocation decisions.

4. **Secure Fund Management**: Multiple security measures including timelock mechanisms, emergency withdrawals, and circuit breakers to protect user funds.

## Future Scope

The initial version of the Yield Optimizer provides a solid foundation, but there are several exciting enhancements planned for future development:

### Short-term Roadmap

1. **Multi-Token Support**: Expand beyond stablecoins to support yield optimization for other tokens including wrapped BTC and ETH.

2. **Yield Aggregation Strategies**: Implement more sophisticated yield farming strategies beyond simple lending, including liquidity provision and staking.

3. **Risk Preference Settings**: Allow users to select their risk tolerance, which will influence the protocols their funds are allocated to.

4. **Mobile App Integration**: Develop mobile interfaces for monitoring yields and managing deposits on the go.

### Long-term Vision

1. **Cross-Chain Optimization**: Expand the optimizer to bridge between multiple chains, finding the best yields across the entire DeFi ecosystem.

2. **Vault Strategies**: Create specialized vaults with different optimization strategies (e.g., stablecoin maximizer, BTC yield vault).

3. **Governance Token**: Introduce a governance token allowing users to participate in protocol decisions and earn a share of protocol fees.

4. **Derivative Products**: Build derivative products on top of the yield-generating positions, such as yield boosters and tranched risk products.

5. **Institutional Services**: Develop specialized services for institutional clients with higher capital efficiency and customizable parameters.

## Technical Documentation

The core of the Yield Optimizer is the `YieldOptimizer.sol` contract, which manages user deposits and yield optimization logic. The contract integrates with various lending protocols on Core Chain and automatically allocates funds to maximize returns.

### Core Function

1. `deposit(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit tokens into the optimizer
2. `withdraw(uint256 amount)`: Enables users to withdraw their tokens plus accrued yield
3. `updateProtocolAPY(Protocol protocol, uint256 newAPY)`: Updates the current APY for a given protocol and potentially triggers rebalancing

For developers interested in contributing or integrating with the Yield Optimizer, please see our detailed technical documentation in the `/docs` folder.

## Getting Started

The smart contract has been deployed to the Core Chain mainnet at:
`0x...` (address to be added after deployment)

To interact with the Yield Optimizer:
1. Connect your wallet to Core Chain
2. Approve the Yield Optimizer contract to spend your tokens
3. Deposit your tokens using the `deposit()` function
4. Monitor your optimized yields through our dApp interface or directly on-chain
